### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Albeit a **former IT systems administrator** :floppy_disk:, I am always eager to learn something new :brain:. In recent years I have been profoundly interested in **web application development** using :fist_right: **`JavaScript && Java`** :fist_left: technologies. However for the last year I have been working as **Java Developer** where I become a bit biased in solving **`Back-End`** problems. Nevertheless I am open to career opportunities in **`Full-Stack || Front-End`** related positions. No matter where I shall grow as a **_software developer_**. :mechanical_arm:
